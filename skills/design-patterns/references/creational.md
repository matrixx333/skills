# Creational Patterns

Creational patterns abstract the instantiation process, making systems independent of how
objects are created, composed, and represented.

---

## Abstract Factory

**Intent:** Provide an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying
their concrete classes.

**Participants:**
- **AbstractFactory** — declares creation methods for each type of product
- **ConcreteFactory** — implements creation for a specific product family (e.g., DarkTheme, LightTheme)
- **AbstractProduct** — interface for a type of product (e.g., Button, Checkbox)
- **ConcreteProduct** — a specific product created by a ConcreteFactory
- **Client** — uses only AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct interfaces

**Structure:**
```
Client --> AbstractFactory
               |
    +----------+----------+
    |                     |
ConcreteFactory1     ConcreteFactory2
    |                     |
ProductA1, ProductB1  ProductA2, ProductB2
```

**Example:**
```
// The abstract factory interface declares a set of methods that
// return different abstract products. These products are called
// a family and are related by a high-level theme or concept.
// Products of one family are usually able to collaborate among
// themselves. A family of products may have several variants,
// but the products of one variant are incompatible with the
// products of another variant.
interface GUIFactory is
    method createButton():Button
    method createCheckbox():Checkbox


// Concrete factories produce a family of products that belong
// to a single variant. The factory guarantees that the
// resulting products are compatible. Signatures of the concrete
// factory's methods return an abstract product, while inside
// the method a concrete product is instantiated.
class WinFactory implements GUIFactory is
    method createButton():Button is
        return new WinButton()
    method createCheckbox():Checkbox is
        return new WinCheckbox()

// Each concrete factory has a corresponding product variant.
class MacFactory implements GUIFactory is
    method createButton():Button is
        return new MacButton()
    method createCheckbox():Checkbox is
        return new MacCheckbox()


// Each distinct product of a product family should have a base
// interface. All variants of the product must implement this
// interface.
interface Button is
    method paint()

// Concrete products are created by corresponding concrete
// factories.
class WinButton implements Button is
    method paint() is
        // Render a button in Windows style.

class MacButton implements Button is
    method paint() is
        // Render a button in macOS style.

// Here's the base interface of another product. All products
// can interact with each other, but proper interaction is
// possible only between products of the same concrete variant.
interface Checkbox is
    method paint()

class WinCheckbox implements Checkbox is
    method paint() is
        // Render a checkbox in Windows style.

class MacCheckbox implements Checkbox is
    method paint() is
        // Render a checkbox in macOS style.


// The client code works with factories and products only
// through abstract types: GUIFactory, Button and Checkbox. This
// lets you pass any factory or product subclass to the client
// code without breaking it.
class Application is
    private field factory: GUIFactory
    private field button: Button
    constructor Application(factory: GUIFactory) is
        this.factory = factory
    method createUI() is
        this.button = factory.createButton()
    method paint() is
        button.paint()


// The application picks the factory type depending on the
// current configuration or environment settings and creates it
// at runtime (usually at the initialization stage).
class ApplicationConfigurator is
    method main() is
        config = readApplicationConfigFile()

        if (config.OS == "Windows") then
            factory = new WinFactory()
        else if (config.OS == "Mac") then
            factory = new MacFactory()
        else
            throw new Exception("Error! Unknown operating system.")

        Application app = new Application(factory)
```

**Key consideration:** Adding a new product type requires changing the AbstractFactory interface
and all ConcreteFactories — a significant ripple effect. Best when the product family is stable.

**When to use:**
- System must be independent of how products are created
- You need to enforce that products from one family are used together
- You want to provide a library of products without exposing implementation

**When NOT to use:**
- When products don't naturally form families
- When adding new product types is more common than adding new families

**Related:** Factory Method (uses inheritance; Abstract Factory uses composition), Builder

---

## Builder

**Intent:** Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so the same
construction process can create different representations.

**Participants:**
- **Builder** — specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a Product
- **ConcreteBuilder** — implements the Builder interface; assembles the product
- **Director** — constructs an object using the Builder interface
- **Product** — the complex object being built

**Structure:**
```
Director --> Builder (buildPartA, buildPartB, getResult)
                 |
         ConcreteBuilder --> Product
```

**Example:**
```
// Using the Builder pattern makes sense only when your products
// are quite complex and require extensive configuration. The
// following two products are related, although they don't have
// a common interface.
class Car is
    // A car can have a GPS, trip computer and some number of
    // seats. Different models of cars (sports car, SUV,
    // cabriolet) might have different features installed or
    // enabled.

class Manual is
    // Each car should have a user manual that corresponds to
    // the car's configuration and describes all its features.


// The builder interface specifies methods for creating the
// different parts of the product objects.
interface Builder is
    method reset()
    method setSeats(...)
    method setEngine(...)
    method setTripComputer(...)
    method setGPS(...)

// The concrete builder classes follow the builder interface and
// provide specific implementations of the building steps. Your
// program may have several variations of builders, each
// implemented differently.
class CarBuilder implements Builder is
    private field car:Car

    // A fresh builder instance should contain a blank product
    // object which it uses in further assembly.
    constructor CarBuilder() is
        this.reset()

    // The reset method clears the object being built.
    method reset() is
        this.car = new Car()

    // All production steps work with the same product instance.
    method setSeats(...) is
        // Set the number of seats in the car.

    method setEngine(...) is
        // Install a given engine.

    method setTripComputer(...) is
        // Install a trip computer.

    method setGPS(...) is
        // Install a global positioning system.

    // Concrete builders are supposed to provide their own
    // methods for retrieving results. That's because various
    // types of builders may create entirely different products
    // that don't all follow the same interface. Therefore such
    // methods can't be declared in the builder interface (at
    // least not in a statically-typed programming language).
    //
    // Usually, after returning the end result to the client, a
    // builder instance is expected to be ready to start
    // producing another product. That's why it's a usual
    // practice to call the reset method at the end of the
    // `getProduct` method body. However, this behavior isn't
    // mandatory, and you can make your builder wait for an
    // explicit reset call from the client code before disposing
    // of the previous result.
    method getProduct():Car is
        product = this.car
        this.reset()
        return product

// Unlike other creational patterns, builder lets you construct
// products that don't follow the common interface.
class CarManualBuilder implements Builder is
    private field manual:Manual

    constructor CarManualBuilder() is
        this.reset()

    method reset() is
        this.manual = new Manual()

    method setSeats(...) is
        // Document car seat features.

    method setEngine(...) is
        // Add engine instructions.

    method setTripComputer(...) is
        // Add trip computer instructions.

    method setGPS(...) is
        // Add GPS instructions.

    method getProduct():Manual is
        // Return the manual and reset the builder.


// The director is only responsible for executing the building
// steps in a particular sequence. It's helpful when producing
// products according to a specific order or configuration.
// Strictly speaking, the director class is optional, since the
// client can control builders directly.
class Director is
    // The director works with any builder instance that the
    // client code passes to it. This way, the client code may
    // alter the final type of the newly assembled product.
    // The director can construct several product variations
    // using the same building steps.
    method constructSportsCar(builder: Builder) is
        builder.reset()
        builder.setSeats(2)
        builder.setEngine(new SportEngine())
        builder.setTripComputer(true)
        builder.setGPS(true)

    method constructSUV(builder: Builder) is
        // ...


// The client code creates a builder object, passes it to the
// director and then initiates the construction process. The end
// result is retrieved from the builder object.
class Application is

    method makeCar() is
        director = new Director()

        CarBuilder builder = new CarBuilder()
        director.constructSportsCar(builder)
        Car car = builder.getProduct()

        CarManualBuilder builder = new CarManualBuilder()
        director.constructSportsCar(builder)

        // The final product is often retrieved from a builder
        // object since the director isn't aware of and not
        // dependent on concrete builders and products.
        Manual manual = builder.getProduct()
```

**Key consideration:** The Director controls the order of construction steps; the Builder
controls what's actually created at each step. A fluent builder (method chaining) skips the
Director entirely — valid and common in modern code.

**When to use:**
- Algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts
- Construction process must allow different representations
- You want to isolate complex construction code from the business logic

**When NOT to use:**
- Simple objects — Builder adds overhead without benefit
- When all products are the same type (Factory Method is simpler)

**Related:** Abstract Factory (creates families; Builder creates step-by-step), Composite
(Builders often build Composite trees)

## Factory Method

**Intent:** Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class
to instantiate.

**Participants:**
- **Creator** — declares the factory method; may provide a default implementation
- **ConcreteCreator** — overrides the factory method to return a specific Product
- **Product** — the interface for the object the factory method creates
- **ConcreteProduct** — implements the Product interface

**Structure:**
```
Creator (factoryMethod()) --> Product
      |                           |
ConcreteCreator          ConcreteProduct
(factoryMethod() returns ConcreteProduct)
```

**Example:**
```
// The creator class declares the factory method that must
// return an object of a product class. The creator's subclasses
// usually provide the implementation of this method.
class Dialog is
    // The creator may also provide some default implementation
    // of the factory method.
    abstract method createButton():Button

    // Note that, despite its name, the creator's primary
    // responsibility isn't creating products. It usually
    // contains some core business logic that relies on product
    // objects returned by the factory method. Subclasses can
    // indirectly change that business logic by overriding the
    // factory method and returning a different type of product
    // from it.
    method render() is
        // Call the factory method to create a product object.
        Button okButton = createButton()
        // Now use the product.
        okButton.onClick(closeDialog)
        okButton.render()


// Concrete creators override the factory method to change the
// resulting product's type.
class WindowsDialog extends Dialog is
    method createButton():Button is
        return new WindowsButton()

class WebDialog extends Dialog is
    method createButton():Button is
        return new HTMLButton()


// The product interface declares the operations that all
// concrete products must implement.
interface Button is
    method render()
    method onClick(f)

// Concrete products provide various implementations of the
// product interface.
class WindowsButton implements Button is
    method render(a, b) is
        // Render a button in Windows style.
    method onClick(f) is
        // Bind a native OS click event.

class HTMLButton implements Button is
    method render(a, b) is
        // Return an HTML representation of a button.
    method onClick(f) is
        // Bind a web browser click event.


class Application is
    field dialog: Dialog

    // The application picks a creator's type depending on the
    // current configuration or environment settings.
    method initialize() is
        config = readApplicationConfigFile()

        if (config.OS == "Windows") then
            dialog = new WindowsDialog()
        else if (config.OS == "Web") then
            dialog = new WebDialog()
        else
            throw new Exception("Error! Unknown operating system.")

    // The client code works with an instance of a concrete
    // creator, albeit through its base interface. As long as
    // the client keeps working with the creator via the base
    // interface, you can pass it any creator's subclass.
    method main() is
        this.initialize()
        dialog.render()
```

**Key consideration:** Factory Method relies on inheritance — subclasses do the specialization.
This can lead to a class hierarchy just to vary what gets created. If that feels heavy, consider
Abstract Factory or a parameterized factory instead.

**When to use:**
- A class can't anticipate which objects it needs to create
- Subclasses should specify the objects they create
- You want to encapsulate object creation logic

**When NOT to use:**
- When the type of object to create is known upfront and doesn't vary
- When subclassing just to override one method feels like overkill

**Related:** Abstract Factory, Template Method (Factory Method is often a Template Method for
object creation), Prototype

---

## Prototype

**Intent:** Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create
new objects by copying (cloning) that prototype.

**Participants:**
- **Prototype** — declares a clone interface
- **ConcretePrototype** — implements the clone operation
- **Client** — creates a new object by asking a prototype to clone itself

**Example:**
```
// Base prototype.
abstract class Shape is
    field X: int
    field Y: int
    field color: string

    // A regular constructor.
    constructor Shape() is
        // ...

    // The prototype constructor. A fresh object is initialized
    // with values from the existing object.
    constructor Shape(source: Shape) is
        this()
        this.X = source.X
        this.Y = source.Y
        this.color = source.color

    // The clone operation returns one of the Shape subclasses.
    abstract method clone():Shape


// Concrete prototype. The cloning method creates a new object
// in one go by calling the constructor of the current class and
// passing the current object as the constructor's argument.
// Performing all the actual copying in the constructor helps to
// keep the result consistent: the constructor will not return a
// result until the new object is fully built; thus, no object
// can have a reference to a partially-built clone.
class Rectangle extends Shape is
    field width: int
    field height: int

    constructor Rectangle(source: Rectangle) is
        // A parent constructor call is needed to copy private
        // fields defined in the parent class.
        super(source)
        this.width = source.width
        this.height = source.height

    method clone():Shape is
        return new Rectangle(this)


class Circle extends Shape is
    field radius: int

    constructor Circle(source: Circle) is
        super(source)
        this.radius = source.radius

    method clone():Shape is
        return new Circle(this)


// Somewhere in the client code.
class Application is
    field shapes: array of Shape

    constructor Application() is
        Circle circle = new Circle()
        circle.X = 10
        circle.Y = 10
        circle.radius = 20
        shapes.add(circle)

        Circle anotherCircle = circle.clone()
        shapes.add(anotherCircle)
        // The `anotherCircle` variable contains an exact copy
        // of the `circle` object.

        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle()
        rectangle.width = 10
        rectangle.height = 20
        shapes.add(rectangle)

    method businessLogic() is
        // Prototype rocks because it lets you produce a copy of
        // an object without knowing anything about its type.
        Array shapesCopy = new Array of Shapes.

        // For instance, we don't know the exact elements in the
        // shapes array. All we know is that they are all
        // shapes. But thanks to polymorphism, when we call the
        // `clone` method on a shape the program checks its real
        // class and runs the appropriate clone method defined
        // in that class. That's why we get proper clones
        // instead of a set of simple Shape objects.
        foreach (s in shapes) do
            shapesCopy.add(s.clone())

        // The `shapesCopy` array contains exact copies of the
        // `shape` array's children.
```

**Key consideration:** Deep vs. shallow copy matters here. A shallow copy duplicates the
top-level object but shares references to nested objects. A deep copy duplicates the entire
object graph. Which you need depends on whether the clone should be fully independent.

**When to use:**
- Classes to instantiate are specified at runtime
- You want to avoid building a class hierarchy of factories
- Instances of a class can have only a few different combinations of state

**When NOT to use:**
- When cloning is expensive (e.g., objects hold external resources)
- When shallow copy semantics would cause subtle shared-state bugs

**Related:** Abstract Factory (can use Prototype to implement), Composite and Decorator
(often use Prototype to clone complex structures)

---

## Singleton

**Intent:** Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

**Participants:**
- **Singleton** — defines an Instance() method; responsible for creating and managing its
  sole instance

**Key consideration:** Singleton is the most controversial GoF pattern. The global access point
makes it easy to reach from anywhere, but that same property makes testing hard (tests share
state), introduces hidden dependencies, and can cause issues in concurrent or distributed
contexts. Consider dependency injection as an alternative — pass the single instance explicitly
rather than accessing it globally.

**Example:**
```
// The Database class defines the `getInstance` method that lets
// clients access the same instance of a database connection
// throughout the program.
class Database is
    // The field for storing the singleton instance should be
    // declared static.
    private static field instance: Database

    // The singleton's constructor should always be private to
    // prevent direct construction calls with the `new`
    // operator.
    private constructor Database() is
        // Some initialization code, such as the actual
        // connection to a database server.
        // ...

    // The static method that controls access to the singleton
    // instance.
    public static method getInstance() is
        if (Database.instance == null) then
            acquireThreadLock() and then
                // Ensure that the instance hasn't yet been
                // initialized by another thread while this one
                // has been waiting for the lock's release.
                if (Database.instance == null) then
                    Database.instance = new Database()
        return Database.instance

    // Finally, any singleton should define some business logic
    // which can be executed on its instance.
    public method query(sql) is
        // For instance, all database queries of an app go
        // through this method. Therefore, you can place
        // throttling or caching logic here.
        // ...

class Application is
    method main() is
        Database foo = Database.getInstance()
        foo.query("SELECT ...")
        // ...
        Database bar = Database.getInstance()
        bar.query("SELECT ...")
        // The variable `bar` will contain the same object as
        // the variable `foo`.
```

**When to use:**
- Exactly one instance of a class is needed (e.g., configuration, logging, thread pool)
- That instance must be accessible from a well-known access point
- The single instance should be extensible by subclassing

**When NOT to use:**
- When you just want "one instance by convention" — DI handles this better
- In test-heavy codebases where shared state between tests is a problem
- In distributed systems where "one instance" doesn't make sense across nodes

**Related:** Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype can all be implemented as Singletons
